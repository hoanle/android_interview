# üì° Kotlin Channels

**Kotlin Channels** are a **concurrency primitive** in Kotlin Coroutines that allow **communication between coroutines**. They are conceptually similar to **queues** and provide a **way to send and receive elements asynchronously**.

Channels are part of Kotlin‚Äôs **coroutine library**, primarily used for **hot, push-based streams** where multiple coroutines can **send** and **receive** values concurrently.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Characteristics of Channels

| Feature                                      | Description                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hot construct**                            | Unlike Flows, Channels actively push values; they do not start lazily. |
| **One-to-one or many-to-many communication** | Multiple coroutines can send or receive messages.                      |
| **Backpressure support**                     | Can suspend the sender when the buffer is full.                        |
| **Buffered vs Rendezvous**                   | Supports buffering with capacity or unbuffered rendezvous behavior.    |

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Creating and Using Channels

### a. Rendezvous Channel (default, capacity = 0)

```kotlin
val channel = Channel<Int>() // default capacity 0

launch {
    channel.send(1)  // suspends until another coroutine receives
    channel.send(2)
}

launch {
    repeat(2) {
        println(channel.receive()) // prints 1, then 2
    }
}
```

* **Rendezvous:** sender waits until receiver is ready.

### b. Buffered Channel

```kotlin
val channel = Channel<Int>(capacity = 3)

launch {
    channel.send(1)
    channel.send(2)
    println("Sent all messages")
}

launch {
    repeat(2) {
        println(channel.receive())
    }
}
```

* Sender can send up to `capacity` values without suspension.
* Useful for **decoupling producer and consumer speeds**.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Broadcast Channels (Deprecated in favor of SharedFlow)

* Channels can be used to **broadcast messages** to multiple receivers.
* Recommended to use **SharedFlow** instead for multiple subscribers.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ When to Use Channels vs Flows

| Feature                  | Channel                                              | Flow                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Hot vs Cold**          | Hot, actively sending                                | Cold by default                               |
| **Backpressure**         | Supported, suspends sender                           | Needs operators like `buffer`                 |
| **One-time events**      | Ideal for producer-consumer queues                   | Can use SharedFlow/StateFlow for hot streams  |
| **Multiple subscribers** | Not ideal; better use SharedFlow                     | Flows + operators support multiple collectors |
| **Use case**             | Communication between coroutines (producer-consumer) | Reactive streams, UI state, transformations   |

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Common Use Cases for Channels

1. **Producer-Consumer Pattern**

   * Example: Downloading images concurrently and processing them.
2. **Event Streams**

   * One coroutine emits events; another consumes them sequentially.
3. **Pipeline Processing**

   * Multiple stages where each stage is a coroutine consuming and producing via channels.
4. **Bridging callback APIs**

   * Convert a callback-based API into a suspending producer-consumer pipeline.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Example: Channel vs Flow

**Channel Example:**

```kotlin
val channel = Channel<Int>()

launch { // Producer
    repeat(5) { channel.send(it) }
    channel.close() // close when done
}

launch { // Consumer
    for (value in channel) {
        println("Received $value")
    }
}
```

**Flow Example (cold, sequential):**

```kotlin
val flow = flow {
    repeat(5) { emit(it) }
}

flow.collect { println(it) }
```

**Key Differences:**

* Channel: **push-based, hot**, suitable for inter-coroutine communication.
* Flow: **pull-based, cold**, suitable for **reactive pipelines** and UI updates.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Summary

* **Channels** = hot, coroutine-native queues for communication between coroutines.
* **Flows** = cold, declarative streams for reactive programming.
* **Use Channels** for **producer-consumer patterns, pipeline processing, or bridging asynchronous events**.
* **Use Flows** for **UI state, reactive transformations, and lifecycle-aware collection**.
