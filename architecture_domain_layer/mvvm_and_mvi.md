# ⚖️ Comparing MVVM vs MVI in Android

MVVM and MVI are two popular architectural patterns for building Android apps, especially with **Jetpack Compose** or reactive UI frameworks.

---

## 1️⃣ MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)

### Structure

```
[View] <--> [ViewModel] <--> [Model / Repository]
```

### Key Concepts

* **View**: Composable, Activity, or Fragment that observes state and renders UI.
* **ViewModel**: Holds **UI state** and exposes it via `LiveData` or `StateFlow`. Handles user events.
* **Model / Repository**: Data layer providing domain models or network/database access.

### State Management

* **State is mutable inside ViewModel**, typically exposed as immutable flows to the UI.
* UI subscribes to state updates via `collectAsState()` or `observe`.

### Event Handling

* UI events are **sent to the ViewModel**, which updates state.
* Events can be user actions like button clicks, text input, or lifecycle events.

### Pros

* Simple to understand and implement.
* Works well with **Jetpack Compose** and **StateFlow / LiveData**.
* Supports incremental adoption in existing projects.

### Cons

* **State can become inconsistent** if multiple UI states are updated simultaneously.
* Not strictly unidirectional → harder to trace complex event flows.

## 2️⃣ MVI (Model-View-Intent)

### Structure

```
[View] --> [Intent] --> [ViewModel / Reducer] --> [Model / Repository] --> [State] --> [View]
```

### Key Concepts

* **Intent**: Represents a **user action or UI event**.
* **Reducer**: Pure function that takes current state + intent → produces **new state**.
* **State**: Single immutable object representing the **entire UI** at a point in time.
* **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Events → State → UI.

### State Management

* **Single source of truth**: the state is immutable.
* Each UI render derives from the current state.
* Ideal for reactive frameworks like Compose.

### Event Handling

* **Intents are dispatched** from the UI to the ViewModel.
* Reducers compute **new state** based on the intent and previous state.
* UI observes **state only**, not individual events.

### Pros

* Predictable and **unidirectional flow** → easier to debug.
* Single state object simplifies testing and reasoning.
* Prevents inconsistent UI states.

### Cons

* More **boilerplate** and complexity than MVVM.
* Overkill for **simple apps or screens** with minimal state.
* Requires strict discipline in managing state immutably.

## 3️⃣ Key Differences: MVVM vs MVI

| Aspect             | MVVM                                                                 | MVI                                                                   |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **State**          | Can be multiple streams or variables; often mutable inside ViewModel | Single immutable state object representing entire UI                  |
| **Event Handling** | Two-way: View observes state, ViewModel updates state                | Unidirectional: View dispatches intents, state flows to UI            |
| **Complexity**     | Simpler, easier to adopt                                             | Higher, but more predictable and testable                             |
| **Boilerplate**    | Less                                                                 | More (reducers, intents, immutable state classes)                     |
| **Testability**    | Moderate                                                             | High, because state transitions are pure and predictable              |
| **Best Use Case**  | Small to medium apps, incremental adoption                           | Medium to large apps with complex UI or high consistency requirements |

---

## ✅ Summary

* **MVVM**: Flexible, easier, may have multiple state sources, can be inconsistent with complex flows.
* **MVI**: Unidirectional, predictable, single immutable state, better for complex UIs, more boilerplate.
* Both patterns are compatible with **Jetpack Compose**, **StateFlow**, and reactive programming.
