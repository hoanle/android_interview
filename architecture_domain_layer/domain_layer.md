# üèóÔ∏è Domain Layer & Use Cases in Android Architecture

## üìå Purpose of the Domain Layer

The **Domain Layer** (or Business Logic Layer) is responsible for:

* Encapsulating **core business rules** of the application.
* Acting as an **abstraction between the UI and data layers**.
* Ensuring the **business logic is platform-independent**, making it easier to test and reuse.
* Exposing **use cases** or operations that describe **what the app can do**, not how the data is stored or presented.

### Key Responsibilities

* Define **domain models** (entities central to the business).
* Contain **use cases/interactors** for all business operations.
* Keep business logic **independent of frameworks, UI, or databases**.

## üìå Use Cases (Interactors)

### Definition

A **Use Case** (or **Interactor**) is a **single, well-defined operation** that represents a business action or feature in the application.

### Example

```kotlin
class GetUserProfileUseCase(private val userRepository: UserRepository) {
    suspend operator fun invoke(userId: String): User {
        return userRepository.getUser(userId)
    }
}
```

* Each use case should **do one thing** (e.g., "get user profile", "place order").
* The UI or ViewModel calls **use cases**, not repositories or data sources directly.

---

### Benefits of Use Cases

1. **Separation of Concerns**

   * UI handles presentation, domain handles business rules, data handles persistence.

2. **Testability**

   * Use cases are plain Kotlin classes ‚Üí easy to unit test independently of Android.

3. **Reusability**

   * Same use case can be used across multiple screens or apps.

4. **Maintainability**

   * Business rules are centralized, making it easier to modify behavior without touching UI or data layers.

5. **Decoupling**

   * UI doesn‚Äôt need to know where data comes from or how operations are implemented.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When Might It Be Overkill?

* **Simple apps** with minimal business logic:

  * Example: a static information app or a simple to-do list with no complex rules.
  * Introducing use cases adds **extra boilerplate** with little benefit.

* **Prototyping / MVPs** where rapid development is needed.

  * May skip a separate domain layer until the app complexity grows.

* **Very small apps** with only one data source and a single UI screen.

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

* **Domain Layer**: Core business logic, independent of UI and data.
* **Use Cases**: Single-purpose operations exposing business actions.
* **Benefits**: Separation of concerns, testability, maintainability, decoupling.
* **Overkill**: Simple apps with little business logic or short-lived prototypes.
