# üß™ Test Driven Development (TDD) in Android

**Test Driven Development (TDD)** is a **software development methodology** where tests are written **before** the actual code. It follows a **‚ÄúRed-Green-Refactor‚Äù** cycle to guide development.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Core Concept

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **Red:** Write a failing test for a feature or behavior you want to implement.
2. **Green:** Write just enough code to make the test pass.
3. **Refactor:** Improve the code while ensuring the test still passes.

```
Write Test ‚Üí Run Test (Fail) ‚Üí Write Code ‚Üí Run Test (Pass) ‚Üí Refactor ‚Üí Repeat
```

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Example in Android (Kotlin)

### Step 1: Write a Failing Test

```kotlin
@Test
fun `adding two numbers returns correct sum`() {
    val calculator = Calculator()
    val result = calculator.add(2, 3)
    assertEquals(5, result)
}
```

> Test fails initially because `Calculator` or `add()` does not exist yet.

### Step 2: Implement Minimal Code

```kotlin
class Calculator {
    fun add(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b
}
```

### Step 3: Run Test (Pass)

* The test now passes.

### Step 4: Refactor if Needed

```kotlin
// Example: if adding more functionality later
class Calculator {
    fun add(vararg numbers: Int) = numbers.sum()
}
```

* Re-run tests to ensure correctness.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Benefits of TDD

| Benefit                       | Description                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Higher Code Quality**       | Code is thoroughly tested from the start.                |
| **Better Design**             | Forces writing modular and testable code.                |
| **Fewer Bugs**                | Bugs are caught earlier in development.                  |
| **Documentation**             | Tests serve as **live documentation** for code behavior. |
| **Confidence in Refactoring** | Refactor safely because tests ensure correctness.        |

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Challenges / Cons of TDD

| Challenge                    | Description                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Slowdown**         | Writing tests first can feel slower initially.       |
| **Overhead for Simple Code** | Very trivial code may not need tests upfront.        |
| **Learning Curve**           | Requires skill in writing good unit tests and mocks. |
| **Maintenance**              | Tests must be maintained alongside code changes.     |

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ TDD in Android Context

* **ViewModel & UseCase Testing:** Write tests for **logic and state changes** before implementing business logic.
* **Repository Testing:** Mock network or database dependencies to test repository behavior first.
* **UI Testing (Compose/Espresso):** Can use **UI tests in TDD** for feature flows, though slower than unit tests.
* **Flows and Coroutines:** Use **Turbine or test dispatchers** to write async tests before implementing coroutine-based logic.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Summary

* **TDD** is a development approach that **prioritizes tests first**.
* It leads to **modular, testable, and robust code**.
* Requires **discipline and proper tooling** (JUnit, MockK, Turbine, ComposeTestRule, Espresso).
* Best applied to **critical business logic and complex modules**, while trivial code may not need strict TDD.

**Key Takeaway:** TDD improves **reliability and design** but comes with **time and maintenance overhead**, which needs balancing with project goals.
