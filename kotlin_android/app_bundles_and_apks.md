# üì¶ Android App Bundles vs APKs

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ APK (Android Package)

* **APK** is the traditional **Android app package format** used for installation on devices.
* Contains:

  * All resources (images, layouts, languages)
  * All compiled code
  * Manifest file
* Delivered as a **single, monolithic file** to all devices.

**Pros:**

* Simple and well-supported.
* Can be installed directly via `adb` or Play Store.

**Cons:**

* Larger file size because it contains **all resources for all device configurations**.
* Every user downloads code and assets they may not need.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Android App Bundle (.aab)

* **App Bundle** is a **publishing format** introduced by Google.
* Not directly installable by devices; used by **Google Play to generate optimized APKs** for each device.
* Contains:

  * All compiled code and resources
  * Metadata for splitting resources (languages, screen densities, ABIs)

**How it works:**

1. Developer uploads `.aab` to Google Play.
2. Play generates **split APKs**:

   * Device-specific APK with only the required resources and code.
   * Reduces app size significantly.
3. Users download the **optimized APK** for their device.

1. **Smaller app downloads**

   * Users download only the resources and code needed for their device.
2. **Dynamic feature modules**

   * Modularize app features and **download on demand**.
3. **Automatic optimization**

   * Google Play generates APKs for different **screen densities, languages, and ABIs** automatically.
4. **Reduced app size**

   * Leads to **better install and update experience**.
5. **Play Store requirements**

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Dynamic Delivery Example

* App has **Base Module** + **Feature Module: AR Viewer**
* Only users accessing AR feature download AR module.
* Reduces initial app size for users who don't use AR.

```text
Base APK: 20MB
AR Feature Module: 10MB
Without dynamic delivery: User downloads 30MB
With .aab: User downloads 20MB initially, 10MB on-demand
```
