# ⚙️ WorkManager in Android

**WorkManager** is a **Jetpack library** for managing **deferrable, guaranteed, and asynchronous background tasks** that **need to run even if the app exits or the device restarts**.

---

## 1️⃣ Key Features

* **Guaranteed Execution:** Ensures tasks run even if the app is killed or device restarts (persistent).
* **Constraint-aware:** Can specify conditions like network availability, charging state, or idle mode.
* **Chaining & Sequencing:** Supports chaining multiple tasks with **dependent execution**.
* **Periodic Work:** Supports **recurring tasks** with minimum interval of 15 minutes.
* **Lifecycle-aware:** Integrates with app lifecycle and **does not require foreground services** for most tasks.
* **Compatible:** Works on API 14+ (backward compatible).

---

## 2️⃣ When to Use WorkManager

WorkManager is ideal for tasks that:

* **Must be executed eventually**, even if the app exits:

  * Uploading logs, analytics events, or crash reports.
  * Syncing offline data to server.
  * Cleaning cache or temporary files.
* **Require constraints**:

  * Network connectivity (`NetworkType.CONNECTED`)
  * Charging state (`setRequiresCharging(true)`)
  * Battery not low (`setRequiresBatteryNotLow(true)`)
* **Need periodic execution**:

  * Daily data sync
  * Regular cleanup tasks

## 3️⃣ Advantages over Other Background Mechanisms

| Mechanism                            | Advantages of WorkManager                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AsyncTask**                        | AsyncTask is short-lived and tied to Activity lifecycle; WorkManager survives app restarts and supports constraints.               |
| **Thread / Handler**                 | Threads are not persistent; WorkManager guarantees execution even after process death.                                             |
| **IntentService / JobIntentService** | WorkManager simplifies job scheduling, handles API differences internally, and supports chaining.                                  |
| **AlarmManager / JobScheduler**      | WorkManager provides a **consistent API across all API levels**, handles constraints, and integrates with modern app architecture. |

## 4️⃣ Core Components

### 4.1 `Worker`

A class that performs the **background work**.

```kotlin
class UploadWorker(
    context: Context,
    params: WorkerParameters
) : Worker(context, params) {

    override fun doWork(): Result {
        // Your background task
        uploadLogs()
        return Result.success()
    }
}
```

### 4.2 `WorkRequest`

Defines how and when work should be executed.

* **OneTimeWorkRequest:** Execute once.
* **PeriodicWorkRequest:** Execute repeatedly at intervals.

```kotlin
val uploadWorkRequest = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<UploadWorker>()
    .setConstraints(
        Constraints.Builder()
            .setRequiredNetworkType(NetworkType.CONNECTED)
            .build()
    )
    .build()
```

### 4.3 `WorkManager`

The central API to **enqueue, manage, and observe work**.

```kotlin
WorkManager.getInstance(context)
    .enqueue(uploadWorkRequest)
```

### 4.4 Observing Work Status

```kotlin
WorkManager.getInstance(context)
    .getWorkInfoByIdLiveData(uploadWorkRequest.id)
    .observe(lifecycleOwner) { workInfo ->
        if (workInfo.state == WorkInfo.State.SUCCEEDED) {
            // Task completed
        }
    }
```

---

## 5️⃣ Work Chaining

WorkManager allows **sequential or parallel tasks**:

```kotlin
val taskA = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<WorkerA>().build()
val taskB = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<WorkerB>().build()
val taskC = OneTimeWorkRequestBuilder<WorkerC>().build()

WorkManager.getInstance(context)
    .beginWith(taskA)     // taskA executes first
    .then(taskB)          // taskB after taskA
    .then(taskC)          // taskC after taskB
    .enqueue()
```

---

## 6️⃣ Summary

* **WorkManager** is the recommended API for **reliable, constraint-based, and deferred background tasks**.
* Advantages over older mechanisms:

  * Survives **app restarts**
  * Works across **all API levels**
  * Supports **constraints, chaining, and periodic work**
* Ideal for:

  * Offline data sync
  * File uploads/downloads
  * Analytics or log uploads
  * Regular maintenance tasks
